		<h2>Hello!</h2>
		<p>I’m Tertia Pentz, a UX Designer based in Sydney. As a storyteller and a problem solver; using curiosity, empathy and design skills I bring beauty and ease of use to people’s lives on a day-to-day basis.</p>
		<p>“I believe that technology only lives up to its promise when it is well designed. Every day I want to make a valuable contribution to the way people interact with ordinary things.”</p>
		<p>Other stuff about me ...</p>
		<p>Reading is my passion and my escape since I was 5 years old, creating photo books keeps my family close, drawing the adventures of Katie (my dog) and TigTig (the cat) makes me laugh, early morning gallops down the Hawkesbury River keeps me sane but then I go and frustrate myself at tennis...</p>
