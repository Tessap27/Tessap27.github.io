	<p>Hello! I’m Tertia Pentz a UX Designer based in Sydney. I’m a storyteller and a problem solver; using curiosity, empathy and design skills I bring beauty and ease of use to people’s lives on a day-to-day basis.</p>

	<br>

	<p>As a graphic designer with a background in print and web I've always been frustrated with receiving an interpretation of a third party’s vision of a problem. Through the UX course at General Assembly I discovered a direct way of making a difference to the way people spent their time, leaving my opinion at the door and focusing on the design decision. I am fascinated by how different users interact differently with the same environment or product and would love to focus more on what makes them tick.</p>

	<p>Other stuff about me ...</p>

	<br>

	<p>Reading is my passion and my escape since I was 5 years old, creating photo books keeps my family close, drawing the adventures of Katie (my dog) and TigTig (the cat) makes me laugh, early morning gallops down the Hawkesbury River keeps me sane but then I go and frustrate myself at tennis...</p>
