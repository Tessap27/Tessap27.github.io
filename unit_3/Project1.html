	<h3>“A consolidation of two enterprise apps"</h3>

	<scr img="images/temp_image.jpg" alt="Sample photo" Text="Sample photo"</scr>

	<p>The scope of this project involved “linking” two enterprise apps used by NBN technicians to install and maintain the NBN network: Atlas Operate and Atlas Wayfinder.

	Operate is a more “job” based app focussed on installing a NBN service with specific deadlines and tasks, whereas Wayfinder focus more on general troubleshooting when the NBN network go down.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
	<p>The challenge was to create a seamless experience linking two apps that not only looked very different visually but worked differently as well.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>
	<p>As this was a very technical project I initially spend my time playing around with both apps, getting a feel of their strong and weak points and understanding the various TELCO technologies the apps catered for. As part of my contract I visited the NBN innovation center, which exposed me to NBN technologies used in the field and specifically in my project. Understanding the technician's workflow was key to this project but it was also not possible to conduct any contextual inquiries or interviews at this stage of the project. For more context I booked a few whiteboard sessions with the architect, BA and business stakeholder brainstorming various scenarios that the field technician may find himself in. Using these scenarios and the BA's stories I started creating rough user flows and paper wireframes, running them past all stakeholders until I was satisfied with a "happy path". The final wireframes were done in Axure and presented to the business for approval. Apon business approval I had the chance to validate these wireframes with a NSO Field Supervisor.</p>

<h3>Delivery and user evaluation</h3>
	<p>Digital Platform's projects are delivered based on the agile development cycle, focusing on two-week iterations with a retro after each project. High-level wireframes (happy path) needs to be approved by business stakeholders and tech leads before the start of the first sprint. Unfortunately due to various other dependencies user evaluation is not always possible before the first sprint starts. Which result in sometimes-fundamental changes in the middle of the project. Another common problem is that in most cases when a new technology is introduced technicians are also not familiar with how they would potentially use it in the field; at best I could test for general usability and any usability issues due to technical constraints would be addresses in a next project.</p>

<h3>User Evaluation and Insights</h3>
	<p>During this project our team encountered numerous problems around the lack of ability of other IT platforms providing ATLAS with "filtered / useful" data vs. a data dump, which resulted in a great deal of scrolling down screens with irrelevant information. We conducted 3 interviews with technicians and a card sort with a field supervisor around what the technicians actually wanted to see when troubleshooting; we had to abandon certain requirements until the relevant platform could solve this issue.</p>

<h3>Atlas Operate</h3>
	<p>The Call Centre would nominate potential faulty assets in the “WorkOrder” using Atlas Operate. The technician then switch to Wayfinder to find the faulty “asset” and troubleshoot; deep link back into Operate with the repaired asset displayed, upload notes and photos and send them to the Call Centre for approval and verification.</p>

<h3>Atlas Wayfinder</h3>
	<p>To keep the switch from Operate to Wayfinder in context and allow users to easily see which assets they should focus on first, the relevant assets were highlighted with an orange glow. As part of the troubleshooting procedure the technician had the option to conduct a trace up the line of connected assets to identify the root cause spanning both copper and fiber networks.</p>
